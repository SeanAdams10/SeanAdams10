- 👋 Hi, I’m @SeanAdams10.    I work in Data Engineering and Analyics in a large US Bank.   Have travelled around the world on assignments to most of the continents, and have a deep passion for helping modernize the skills of folk in our company to become natives of this more technical workforce and work environment that we find ourselves in.
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use GitHub in an environment where folks are not as technically savvy, so that they can use this for Alteryx and Tableau and Business Objects assets (Business Intelligence & Data Engineering projects)
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use GITHub for code versioning and how to buidl new Alteryx tools using the Python SDK
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on new Alteryx tools using the SDK
